# Fantasy-Football-Python
My first time working with Postman and the Sleeper API to extract JSON Files. This is not my primary Python Project, and is more of an exploratory analysis project that will take the backburner to my other work.

I am currently looking at better ways of data collection for fantasy football analysis, but practicing JSON imports is good
